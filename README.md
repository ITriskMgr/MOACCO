# MOACCO
The name is based on the acronym for Mother of all cybersecurity compliance ontologies. Think of this as Academic humour.

This repository was created from searches on Google and in the scientific litterature for everyting related to cybersecurity and compliance. It is intended to be used by the cybersecurity compliance ontology project by Pr Marc-André Léger (https://www.linkedin.com/in/itriskmgr/) at Polytechnique Montréal (https://www.polymtl.ca/). It contains all the data, test files and reults from the tests that are or were used in the project.

Theses are provided to the collaborators and reviewers to contribute, use, document or improve the project.

For information and requests: marcandre@leger.ca

This is an ongoing project and the readme will be improved as we go along. At this time, it is starting with the addition and re-use of existing ontologies to create a larger ontology of everything that is related to IT compliance. This includes, but is not limited to, vocabulary, metrics, roles and frameworks.You can see the annotations to get an idea of all the existing ontologies that have been added and imported. A complete list of references will be added as soon as possible. Basically, anything we can find is added. 

Any reuse should be discussed with the project team.
